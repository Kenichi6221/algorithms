# Segmet tree:

A segment tree is a structure that allows asking about segment data in some array, so in one array if starting_pos<=a and ending_pos>=b with a segment tree, we can answer queries like following:

- what is the sum between [a,b] where a and b belows to some array
- What is the minimum element between [a,b]
- What is the maximum element between [a,b]
