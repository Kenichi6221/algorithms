# ALGORITMS IMPROVING

This project contains an algorithmic topics collection the main branch will contain, theory and examples used as tools to resolve algorithmic problems contained in distinct competence pages.

## Goals:

- Improve analysis skills
- Practicing a systematic and structured approach to resolve algorithms challenges

## Branches:

This project will contain several and distinct branches related to programming challenges pages, each branch will contain advice and notes regarded with tools or material extra to
improve the code experience and solving problems skills.

The following list summarizes the expected contend regarded to classification branch:

- **Main**: Theory and examples base to tackle distinct programming challenges
- **Challenge page's branch**: It is related to a specific web page with programming challenges (e.g leetcode or hackerranck), will contain folders with the challenge number and descriptive name, in addition, each folder will contain a readme.md with related analysis and theory applied to solve the challenge.
